# My configs


## Setup

1. Install karabiner.

2. Install alfred 4.

3. Install alacritty.

4. Install neovim.

5. Install ohmyzsh.

6. Clone the repo to ~/dotfiles.

7. Run ./setup.sh.

8. Run vim and then :PlugInstall


## Karabiner

Most useful settings are: Caps/Enter as Enter when nothing else is pressed and Caps/Enter as Conrol if pressed something else.

I also mapped Cmd+hjkl to vim-like cursor movements in Mac OS. It's useful in all applications.


## Alfred workflows

Cmd-1 Firefox

Cmd-2 Alacritty

Cmd-3 WebStorm (for transition period)

Cmd-4 Slack

Cmd-0 Sublime (with opened todo.txt file)

Don't open these apps in fullscreen mode and you will switch between them immediately.
